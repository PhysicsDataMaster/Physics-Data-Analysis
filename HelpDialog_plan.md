# HelpDialog Structure & Planning Overview

This document outlines the organizational plan used for generating the HelpDialog system used in v5.1.

## Main Sections

1. **Overview, Menus, Usage**
2. **HelpDialog architecture**
3. **Function Reference** (A–Z across Functions1 and Functions2)
4. **Glossary**
5. **Custom UI tips**
6. **Examples, Formulas, and Export notes**

## Generation Principles

- Every function must include: Purpose, Parameters, Usage, Issues, Tips
- Functions are grouped alphabetically (Functions1: A–M, Functions2: N–Z)
- LaTeX preview and sidebar width are considered for user clarity
- Redundant headers trimmed after integrity check

## v5.2 Prep Notes

- Future functions like `postRegressionResults` already included
- Final placeholder sections use internal linking and full glossary hooks
